  abstract = {An alternative model to the formation of pyramidal structures is presented in the framework of social systems. The population is assumed to be distributed between two social orientations G and H with respective probabilities p0 and (1 − p0). Instead of starting the hierarchy with a given H-orientation at the top and then going downwards in a deterministic way, the hierarchy is initiated randomly at the bottom from the surrounding population. Every level is then selected from the one underneath using the principle of majority rule. The hierarchy is thus self-oriented at the top. It is shown how such self-oriented hierarchies are always H-oriented provided they have a minimal number of levels which is determined by the value of p0. Their stability is studied against increases in p0. An ideal transition to G-self-oriented hierarchies is obtained.},

  abstract = {Real-space renormalization group ideas are used to study a voting problem in political science. A model to construct self-directed pyramidal structures from bottom up to the top is presented. Using majority rules, it is shown that a minority and even a majority can be systematically self-eliminated from top leadership, provided the hierarchy has a minimal number of levels. In some cases, 70\% of the population is found to have zero representation after six hierarchical levels. Results are discussed with respect to the internal operation of political organizations.},
